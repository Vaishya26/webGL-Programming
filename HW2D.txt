Description of the Working Demo:

As 3 Different shapes has to be rendered, we have taken Triangle, Square and Circle into consideration.
For Triangle 3 (x,y) Co-ordinates have been taken within [-1,+1].
For Square, Co-ordinates for 2 Triangles have been taken as input.
For Circle, A polygon with 360 segments have been considered and Co-ordinates have been calculated programmatically.
Finally, an event listener "click" has been added to the canvas through `toggleOnClick` fucntion.
Selection of shape is decided based on Global Counter variable and switch cases.
Based on Shape selected, vertices gets transferred to GPU through bufferData for rendering.
